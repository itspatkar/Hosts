# Hosts Script
Bash script to create a uniq &amp; sorted hostlist from multiple sources.

## Configuration :
- `LOCAL_HOST` : local server to which the request is redirected, set to `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` (default is `0.0.0.0`)
- `OUTPUT_HOST` : output hosts-styled blocklist (default is `hosts.txt`)
- `source.list` : plain text file from which hosts-styled sources are to be fetch
- `source.domain` : plain text file from which only ip/domain sources are to be fetch

**NOTE -**
- `source.list` : should have only host-styled format sources, Ex- `0.0.0.0 www.example.com`
- `source.domain` : should have only ip/domain format sources, Ex- `www.example.com`

## Usage :
- Clone repo
- Add hosts sources/links in `source.list` and `source.domain` per line *(remember above noted points)*
- If the list has only one entry, then add an extra empty line at the end. *(some issue in script/curl)*
- Run `generate.sh`
